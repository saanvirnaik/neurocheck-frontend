## 💡 Inspiration

This project was inspired by **Saanvi Naik’s** volunteering work at *Stable Influence*, a therapeutic horse-riding center where children with autism and other developmental conditions come for equine therapy.  
Seeing the positive change early intervention brought to these children motivated her to create a digital tool that helps families begin the journey toward awareness and support.
